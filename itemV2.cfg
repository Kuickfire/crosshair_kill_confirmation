title = "Crosshair Kill Confirmation";
description = "Shows an additional indicator around the crosshair when you kill something, or assist in killing something.

Uses separate shapes for regular enemies, elites and specials to make it more immediately obvious what you've killed in the heat of battle without needing to glance up at the kill feed.

Compatible with all other crosshair mods, as this does not modify the default crosshairs in any way.
